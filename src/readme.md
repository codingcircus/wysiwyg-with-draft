# DraftJS Editor with Plugins

For a few projects I want to start in the future, I'm currently trying out [Draft.js](https://draftjs.org) and [DraftJS Plugins](https://www.draft-js-plugins.com).

The Editor Component can be used inside other projects, without much work (I hope), however state management is still missing.

## Todos

- Save State for page reloads
- Look into Read Only Mode
- Check Export functionality
